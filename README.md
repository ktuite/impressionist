Impressionist Fingerpaint code in Processing

- Step 1. Get Processing from http://processing.org/ 
- Step 2. Open 'impressionist.pde' in Processing!

What it does:
- Loads an image (semi-transparently) and lets you re-paint that image with custom brush styles that make your photo look non-photorealistic and impressionistic instead!
